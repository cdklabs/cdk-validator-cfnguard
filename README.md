## Usage

To use this plugin in your CDK application add it to the CDK App.

```ts
new App({
  validationPlugins: [
    new CfnGuardValidator(),
  ],
});
```

By default the `CfnGuardValidator` plugin comes with the [Control Tower
proactive
controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/proactive-controls.html)
enabled. In order to disable these rules you can use the
`controlTowerRulesEnabled: false` property.

```ts
new CfnGuardValidator({
  controlTowerRulesEnabled: false,
});
```

It is also possible to disable individual rules.

```ts
new CfnGuardValidator({
  disabledRules: [
    'ct-s3-pr-1',
  ],
});
```

### Additional rules

To provide additional rules to the plugin, provide a list of local
file or directory paths.

```ts
new CfnGuardValidator({
  rules: [
    path.join(__dirname, 'local-rules'),
    path.join(__dirname, 's3', 'local-rules', 'my-rule.guard'),
  ]
});
```

If the path provided is a directory then the directory must only
contain guard rule files, and all rules within the directory will be used.
